```

## Usefull Commands

- `dev`: runs your application on `localhost:3000`
- `build`: creates the production build version
- `start`: starts a simple server with the build production code
- `lint`: runs the linter in all components and pages
- `test`: runs jest to test all components and pages
- `test:watch`: runs jest in watch mode
- `storybook`: runs storybook on `localhost:6006`
- `build-storybook`: create the build version of storybook

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
